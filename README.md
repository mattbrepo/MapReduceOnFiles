# MapReduceOnFiles
Test of [MapReduce idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) on text files. 

**Language: C#**

**Start: 2015**

## Why
I wanted to explore the concept of MapReduce and apply it on simple text files.

## Example
I took four Jane Austen books from the [Project Gutemberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top):
* [Emma](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158)
* [Sense and Sensibility](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/161)
* [Persuasion](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/105)
* [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342)

and searched for the most common words.

Words with at least 5 characters that occur at least 1000 times:

```
could: 2392
every: 1109
should: 1049
their: 1538
there: 1390
which: 2122
would: 2154
```
